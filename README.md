GaiaMind üåç Environmental Dashboard

GaiaMind is an AI-powered environmental monitoring dashboard providing real-time insights into air quality, wildfires, flood risk, and environmental news for selected cities. The platform is designed to support data-driven decision-making, urban planning, and environmental awareness.

Features

Air Quality Monitoring (AQI)
Visualise and track real-time air quality metrics for multiple cities, with average AQI and historical trends.

Wildfire Tracking
Monitor active wildfires around the world, with geospatial mapping of affected areas.

Flood Risk Assessment
Evaluate current flood risk levels using real-time data sources and predictive scoring.

Environmental News Feed
Stay updated with the latest news on environmental events, disasters, and policies from multiple sources.

Interactive Interface
Select multiple cities, explore metrics, charts, and maps, and hover over graphs for detailed information.

Demo

Live App: GaiaMind on Streamlit
